# User logged in indicator

Q: When a user is logged in they need some kind of indicator on every page that they are logged in.

Indication of user logged in or not is located at the top right corner along side the application navigation.
When user logged in, it shows the name and photo of the logged in user.
If user not logged in, it shows a login button instead for user to login.
